# VM15D : Hamiltonian fluid reduction of the 1.5D Vlasov-Maxwell equations

- **VM15D.nb**: [Mathematica notebook] checks the Jacobi identity and the Casimir invariants for the bracket Bracket[F,G] given by Eq. (6) of the article  *Hamiltonian fluid reduction of the 1.5D Vlasov-Maxwell equations* by C. Chandre and B.A. Shadwick


- **GrowthRates.mlx**: [Matlab livescript] computes the growth rates for the linearized equations of motion near a homogeneous equilibrium. It reproduces the figures of the article *Hamiltonian fluid reduction of the 1.5D Vlasov-Maxwell equations* by C. Chandre and B.A. Shadwick

- `VM15D python code`
  - [`VM15D_dict.py`](https://github.com/cchandre/VM15D/blob/main/VM15D_dict.py): to be edited to change the parameters of the VM15D computation (see below for a dictionary of parameters)

  - [`VM15D.py`](https://github.com/cchandre/VM15D/blob/main/VM15D.py): contains the VM15D class and main functions (not to be edited)

  - [`VM15D_modules.py`](https://github.com/cchandre/VM15D/blob/main/VM15D_modules.py): contains the methods to run VM15D (not to be edited)

  - Once [`VM15D_dict.py`](https://github.com/cchandre/VM15D/blob/main/VM15D_dict.py) has been edited with the relevant parameters, run the file as 
  ```sh
  python3 VM15D.py
  ```
  - NB: in case of error, check your version of the python modules used in the code (see [`modules_version.txt`](https://github.com/cchandre/VM15DD/blob/main/modules_version.txt))
