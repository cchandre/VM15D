# VM15D : Hamiltonian fluid reduction of the 1.5D Vlasov-Maxwell equations

- **VM15D.nb**: [Mathematica notebook] checks the Jacobi identity and the Casimir invariants for the bracket Bracket[F,G] given by Eq. (6) of the article  *Hamiltonian fluid reduction of the 1.5D Vlasov-Maxwell equations* by C. Chandre and B.A. Shadwick


- **GrowthRates.mlx**: [Matlab livescript] computes the growth rates for the linearized equations of motion near a homogeneous equilibrium. It reproduces the figures of the article *Hamiltonian fluid reduction of the 1.5D Vlasov-Maxwell equations* by C. Chandre and B.A. Shadwick
